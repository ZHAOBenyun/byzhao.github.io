        - [Oct. 2024] 🎉 Multi-object hallucination is accepted to NeurIPS and Teachable Reinforcement Learning is accepted to EMNLP. Check them out!
        
        - [June 2024] 🚀 We released 3D-GRAND, the first million-scale densly-grounded 3D-text dataset for 3D-LLMs! Trained with this data, our model obtained stronger 3D grounding capabilities and drastically reduces hallucinations. We also proposed and released 3D-POPE, a benchmark to evaluate 3D-text hallucinations for 3D-LLMs. Try out live demo on our website!
        
        - [Feb. 2024] ⭐ I will join the Meta Embodied AI team Summer 2024 as a Research Scientist Intern!
        
        - [Jan. 2024] 🎉 LLM-Grounder is accepted to ICRA 2024!
