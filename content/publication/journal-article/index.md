abstract: Infrastructure defect detection plays a vital role in ensuring structural safety and maintenance efficiency. However, the lack of high-quality datasets has hindered the development of automated defect detection systems. This paper presents CUBIT-Det, a comprehensive infrastructure defect detection dataset containing 12,000+ high-resolution images with detailed annotations. The dataset covers various defect types including cracks, spalling, exposed rebar, and water seepage, collected from real-world infrastructure using unmanned aerial vehicles and ground robots. We provide extensive validation of the dataset using state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness for developing robust defect detection systems.

abstract = {Visual inspection of civil infrastructures has traditionally been a crucial yet labor-intensive task. In contrast, unmanned robots equipped with deep learning-based visual defect detection methods offer a more comprehensive and efficient solution compared to conventional manual inspection techniques. However, the full potential of deep learning in defect detection has yet to be fully realized, primarily due to the scarcity of annotated, high-quality defect datasets. In this study, we introduce CUBIT-Det, a high-resolution defect detection dataset that includes over 5500 images captured under various scenarios using professional-grade equipment. Distinguishing itself from existing datasets, CUBIT-Det encompasses a wide array of practical situations, backgrounds, and defect categories. We perform extensive benchmarking experiments on the dataset with nearly 30 cutting-edge real-time detection methods, and analyze both the impact of the dataset's annotation methods and zero-shot transfer ability of it. This effort lays a robust foundation for future advancements in defect detection solutions. Additionally, the practicality and effectiveness of CUBIT-Det are confirmed through thorough inspections of real-world buildings. Finally, we detail the features and acknowledge the limitations of our dataset, thereby highlighting significant opportunities for future research.}
